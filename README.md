# Personal Setup

This is a set of instructions that I use for personal setup/configuration of my
development environments.

Currently, this only has Windows+WSL configuration, but will be expanded to
include my Linux and MacOS configuration(s) in the future, when I next have to
setup either of those environments.

## Specific Setup Instructions
